# The Complex Genome: Structure to Function
The Complex Genome Course of the Graduate Seminar Program (GSP) - Summer 2023

The Complex Genome: Structure to Function (gspGenome) is a Graduate Seminar Program course run by One Lights Edu in the Summer of 2023.

Author and course director: **Diwen (Steven) Gan** ([digan@ucsd.edu](mailto:digan@ucsd.edu))

# Overview

In eukaryotes, the genome is extensively compacted inside the nucleus, hierarchically organized at a multiscale of structural units. One of the most critical roles of these delicately regulated structures is the control of transcriptional dynamics. Transcriptional regulations have been recognized as the primary regulatory mechanisms coordinating cellular activities, responses, cell type and fate determinations. No doubt, regulations on transcription are hugely achieved by changes in regulatory factors and structural configuration. Yet, with more than two hundred years of study on the genome, we are just starting to realize the complexity lies within …
